HEREUPON LEGRAND AROSE, WITH A GRAVE AND STATELY AIR, AND BROUGHT ME THE BEETLE
FROM A GLASS CASE IN WHICH IT WAS ENCLOSED. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCARABAEUS, AND, AT

OF VIEW. THERE WERE TWO ROUND BLACK SPOTS NEAR ONE EXTREMITY OF THE BACK, AND A
LONG ONE NEAR THE OTHER. THE SCALES WERE EXCEEDINGLY HARD AND GLOSSY, WITH ALL THE
APPEARANCE OF BURNISHED GOLD. THE WEIGHT OF THE INSECT WAS VERY REMARKABLE, AND,
TAKING ALL THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION, I COULD HARDLY BLAME JUPITER FOR HIS OPINION
RESPECTING IT.
