To get the flag we need to be able to call `data_read()` and then input `0` to get the flag

To do that the variable `inputs` must be > 0

Every succesful `data_write()` call increments `inputs` by 1

Once you enter a word to the database, enter '2' to call `data_read()`. By then, your input should be 1 assuming you entered one string into the database.

Then input '0' to satisfy the following if condition in `data_read()`:
```c
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
```

The program will return `picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_00AAD6B3}`
