### Current progress: not done

A `vuln` and `vuln.c` file and source code file is given

`vuln` is a i386, 32bit little endian executable (checked via `checksec` command).
It also has NX enabled.

Looking into the code, we found something interesting with it:
```c
if (memcmp(canary,global_canary,CANARY_SIZE)) {
    printf("***** Stack Smashing Detected ***** : Canary Value Corrupt!\n"); // crash immediately
    exit(-1);
}
```
Seems like the file has its own stack canary check!
