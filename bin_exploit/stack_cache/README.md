### Current progress: not done

A `vuln` binary and `vuln.c` source code is given.

`checksec` shows us that `vuln` is a i386-32bit little-endian executable.
It has stack canary and NX-bits enabled.

While we were trying to find symbols for `exec`, we found these following things:
```
objdump -t ./vuln | grep exec
080ae9f0 l     F .text  000007e0 execute_cfa_program
080496b5 l     F .text  00000008 execute_cfa_program.cold
080af9a0 l     F .text  0000068b execute_stack_op
080496cf l     F .text  0000000e execute_stack_op.cold
080a42c0 g     F .text  00000063 _dl_make_stack_executable
080e7cb4 g     O .data  00000004 _dl_make_stack_executable_hook
```

One that seems interesting is `_dl_make_stack_executable`. We have found a couple of past CTF write-ups regarding this function:
- [ret_to_stack](https://quentinmeffre.fr/pwn/2017/01/26/ret_to_stack.html)
- [SAD binary](https://ctftime.org/writeup/22772)   

We tried to follow these write-ups. However, we can't find the matching ROP gadgets that would lead us to the shell.
