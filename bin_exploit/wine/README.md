### Current progress: not Done

A `vuln.exe` is given alongside the `vuln.c` source code. 

The file command shows that `vuln.exe` is an i386-32bit windows executable.
Since we are using `wsl` anyway, we can run this without the need of wine (allow the file from windows defender first, since it detected this as a virus when we know its just bad coding).

### TODO:
- find a good way to check security protection and debug this.
- [pwntools for windows](https://github.com/masthoon/pwintools)?
