## Current progress: Done

After launching the instance. A `vuln` executable and `vuln.c` was given

`file` command shows `vuln` as an unstripped ELF 32-bit, Intel 80386 (i386)
`checksec` shows vuln file to be `i386-32-little`. Moreover, it shows no security protection for buffer overflow.

In `vuln.c`, we found the `win` function which reads and gives out the flag
```
void win() {
  char buf[FLAGSIZE];
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(buf,FLAGSIZE,f);
  printf(buf);
}
```

Using grep and objdump as follow: `objdump -t ./vuln | grep win`, we can acquire the address of "win" function at `0x080491f6`

With this, we can craft a pwntools command at [exploit.py](exploit.py)

after testing with a local test flag, we then change the script to remote into the server.
This gives out our flag: `picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy_60fac6aa}`
