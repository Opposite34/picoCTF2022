### Current progress: Done

The prompt of the challenge is the following:

```
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. 
I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row.
```

A `game-redacted.c` file for the program was given alongside a `netcat` command to connect to the server hosting this program.

It seems like the program asks for a command `1` or `2` (play or exit the game) and then prompts the user for an input.
These inputs seems to anticipated for the user to type either `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`,
and it seems like we have to win the game 5 times in a row to get the flag.

We took a look at the code and found these parts of the code to be of noted:
```c
char* hands[3] = {"rock", "paper", "scissors"};
char* loses[3] = {"paper", "scissors", "rock"};
int wins = 0;
```
This part seems to store the hands and loses array for the computer to use.

In the `play` function, it seems like the computer is using the loses array to check if the computer win or lose:

```c
bool play () {
  char player_turn[100];
  srand(time(0));
  int r;

  printf("Please make your selection (rock/paper/scissors):\n");
  r = tgetinput(player_turn, 100);

  ...

  int computer_turn = rand() % 3;
  printf("You played: %s\n", player_turn);
  printf("The computer played: %s\n", hands[computer_turn]);

  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
  } else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
  }
}
```
As can be seen above, it seems like the computer checks our input with the a random element in the `loses` array
using `strstr` function.

According to [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strstr.htm),
`strstr` seems to return a value when the 2nd parameter is a substring of the 1st parameter!!

That means that we can cheese the program by inputting `rockpaperscissors` all at once, 
and we should theoretically win everytime!

We crafted a simple [cheese.py](cheese.py) script so we don't have to type stuffs 5 times and the ran:
```bash
python cheese.py | nc saturn.picoctf.net 52524
```

Which gives us the flag: `picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_32F730C2}`
