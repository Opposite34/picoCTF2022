### Current progress: not done

The `vuln` binary and `vuln.c` source file was given.

According to the `checksec` command, `vuln` is an i386, 32bit little-endian binary with stack canary.

From searching up stack canary, we found [this post on CTF101](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/stack-canaries/) explaning
how stack canary detects buffer overflow attacks. 

However, `checksec` also shows us that there are `RWX segments` (read, write, execute), which could be handy for us (an attacker).

Running the `vuln` prompts `How strong is your ROP-fu? Snatch the shell from my hand, grasshopper!` and asks us for
an input.

From the challenge name and this prompt, it leads us to believe that we have to use Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) type
of buffer overflow attack on this binary.

We looked into [John Hammond's video](https://youtu.be/i5-cWI_HV8o) on ROP to see how we could craft our [exploit.py](exploit.py).

However, we are unable to find anything at all in the GOT (Global Offset Table) produced by `pwntools`...

### TODO
- find a way to get the libc of the server anyway somehow. OR
- try to find a way to do this without the above
