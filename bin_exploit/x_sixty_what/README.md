### Current progress: not done

A `vuln` executable and `vuln.c` was given.

We checked via `file` and `checksec` command which shows that `vuln` is a:
- amd64 little endian
- unstripped ELF binary
- NX is enabled

64 bit binary is a bit tricky to overflow, as sometimes you need to realign the stack by 
16 bytes when `MOVDQA` is used alongside `XMM` register (see [this blog post we found](https://mudongliang.github.io/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_183.html)).

To be frank, we don't particularly know how to get cyclic to work with 64 bit executable. So, we are going to find the offset the manual way with python.

We found out that the offset for this executable is at `65`
via running `python -c 'print("A" * 65)' | ./vuln`.
(This also perfectly matches the buffer size in the c source code being `64`).

Next, we made our [script.py](script.py) to match the buffer overflow attack needed:
- using `amd64` as the context architecture

However, when we tried to run the `script.py`. It seems to `SIGSEGV`.
We found out after this that there's a hint on the picoCTF site saying the following:

```
Jump to the second instruction (the one after the first push) in the flag function, if you're getting mysterious segmentation faults.
```

So TODO: Investigate what is going on here
