### Current progress: Done

Website has many hidden directories:
At first we found the `secret/` from opening the stock image on the website in new tab.
Then, we found the `secret/hidden` from the css file linking (in page source).
Similarly, the page source in `secret/hidden` links us to `secret/hidden/superhidden/`

The flag is hidden in `secret/hidden/superhidden/`:
`picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_34327aaf}`
