### Current progress: Done

According to the challenge name. This is going to be dealing with either the font `Roboto Sans` or `robots.txt`
The font thing seems to not be the case here. 
So we look into `/robots.txt` file in the website.
Learn more about it [here](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html).

This is in the `robots.txt`:
```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```

`ZmxhZzEudHh0` and `anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==` seems to be base64 
which decodes as `flag1.txt` and `js/myfile.txt` respectively.

`flag1.txt` doesn't seems to exist, so we look into `js/myfile.txt` and found the flag:
`picoCTF{Who_D03sN7_L1k5_90B0T5_a4f5cc70}`
