The challenges says:
```
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. 
```

The website is a website eReader with some PDF files. We can read these files by typing `filename.txt`.
According to the challenge prompt, we can't just type in `/flag`, but what we can do is climb up the path relatively using the
parent path `../` symbol.

So we climb up the path four times and put this into the query field: `../../../../flag.txt`
And we get our flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_26b22ab3}`
