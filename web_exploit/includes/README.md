### Current progress: Done

A website was given. With it is a paragraph about "includes".
So, this is probably about the "inclusion" of files in website.

We clicked the button `Say hello`, which alerts us that `This code is in a separate file!`.
So we viewed the page source, and found that `style.css` and `script.js` was "included".

The `style.css` file shows the following:
```
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```
which is our first part of the flag.


The `script.js` file gives us the second part:
```
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_f4593d9d}
```

Put them together and we get our flag: `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_f4593d9d}`
